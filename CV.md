## About Me

I am a keen, modern yet experienced agile full stack software developer, specialising in .NET, delivering code to a consistently high standard. I have been writing code since 14 years old and I am still loving it!


## Passion for the Web

I love the web and building fast, effective web applications and progressive web apps. Much needed changes have been happening in the web development world recently, and this is thanks to the emergence and acceptance from leading browsers of web component standards which has been quoted many times as the next generation of web development. This has made a huge change to how we can build progressive web apps and utilise mobile devices without the need of building native mobile apps.
